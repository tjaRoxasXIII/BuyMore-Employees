Thanks for taking the time to take a look at this Repository.  To meet requirements for my curriculum at Flatiron Schools, I took a little inspiration from an internal employee website hosted by the company I used to work for and built a simpler version themed around "BuyMore" from the television series 'Chuck'.

ToDo:

Run a quick 'bundle install' after cloning and navigating to this repo's directory to grab the necessary gems required to run this application.  You can begin hosting by running the command 'shotgun' in your terminal and then navigating to localhost:9393 in your web-browser of choice.
