# BuyMore_Employees

Thanks for taking the time to take a look at this Repository. To meet requirements for my curriculum at Flatiron Schools, I took a little inspiration from an internal employee website hosted by the company I used to work for and built a simpler version themed around "BuyMore" from the television series 'Chuck'.
